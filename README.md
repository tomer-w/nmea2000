# NMEA 2000 Python Library

A Python library for encoding and decoding NMEA 2000 frames. The encoding and decoding is based on the extensive [canboat](https://canboat.github.io/canboat/canboat.html) database. It also support cheap CANBUS USB and TCP devices as a gateways between you NMEA 2000 boat network and any python code which want to recieve or send those messages.

## Features

- **Decode NMEA 2000 frames**: Parse and interpret raw NMEA 2000 data.
- **Encode NMEA 2000 frames**: Convert structured data back into the NMEA 2000 frame format.
- **USB client**: Send and receive NMEA 2000 data over CANBUS USB devices like [Waveshare USB-CAN-A](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/USB-CAN-A)
- **TCP client**: Send and receive NMEA 2000 data over CANBUS TCP devices like:
     - [EBYTE ECAN-W01S](https://www.cdebyte.com/products/ECAN-W01S)
     - [EBYTE ECAN-E01](https://www.cdebyte.com/products/ECAN-E01)
     - [Actisense W2K-1](https://actisense.com/products/w2k-1-nmea-2000-wifi-gateway/)
     - [Yacht Devices YDEN-02](https://yachtdevicesus.com/products/nmea-2000-ethernet-gateway-yden-02)
- **PGN-specific parsing**: Handle various PGNs with specific parsing rules based on [canboat](https://canboat.github.io/canboat/canboat.html).
- **Stateful decoder**: The decoder support NMEA 2000 fast messages which are split between CANBUS messages.
- **CLI support**: Built-in command-line interface for encoding and decoding frames.

## Installation

You can install the library using `pip`:

```bash
pip install nmea2000
```

Or you can clone the repository and install it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomer-w/nmea2000.git
cd nmea2000
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Decode NMEA 2000 Frame (CLI)

To decode a frame, use the `decode` command followed by the frame in actisense hex format:

```bash
nmea2000-cli decode --frame "09FF7 0FF00 3F9FDCFFFFFFFFFF"

65280 Furuno: Heave: Manufacturer Code = Furuno (bytes = "3F 07"), Reserved = 3 (bytes = "03"), Industry Code = Marine (bytes = "04"), Heave = -0.036000000000000004 (bytes = "DC"), Reserved = 65535 (bytes = "FF FF 00")
```
```json
And in JSON format:
{"PGN":65280,"id":"furunoHeave","description":"Furuno: Heave","fields":[{"id":"manufacturer_code","name":"Manufacturer Code","description":"Furuno","unit_of_measurement":"","value":"Furuno","raw_value":1855},{"id":"reserved_11","name":"Reserved","description":"","unit_of_measurement":"","value":3,"raw_value":3},{"id":"industry_code","name":"Industry Code","description":"Marine Industry","unit_of_measurement":"","value":"Marine","raw_value":4},{"id":"heave","name":"Heave","description":"","unit_of_measurement":"m","value":-0.036000000000000004,"raw_value":-36},{"id":"reserved_48","name":"Reserved","description":"","unit_of_measurement":"","value":65535,"raw_value":65535}],"source":9,"destination":255,"priority":7}

```

### Example Code

```python
from nmea2000.decoder import NMEA2000Decoder

# Initialize decoder
decoder = NMEA2000Decoder()

# Decode a frame
frame_str = "09FF7 0FF00 3F9FDCFFFFFFFFFF"
decoded_frame = decoder.decode_actisense_string(frame_str)

# Print decoded frame
print(decoded_frame)
```

### TCP Client CLI

```bash
nmea2000-cli tcp_client --server 192.168.0.46 --port 8881 --type actisense
```

### TCP Client code

```python
async def handle_received_data(message: NMEA2000Message):
    """User-defined callback function for received data."""
    print(f"Callback: Received {message}")
    
client = EByteNmea2000Gateway(ip, port)
client.set_receive_callback(handle_received_data)  # Register callback
```

### Encode NMEA 2000 Frame (CLI)
TBD
You can also encode data into NMEA 2000 frames using the `encode` command:

```bash
nmea2000-cli encode --data "your_data_to_encode"
``` 

Example:
```bash
nmea2000-cli encode --data 'mea2000-cli encode --frame '{"PGN":65280,"id":"furunoHeave","description":"Furuno: Heave","fields":[{"id":"manufacturer_code","name":"Manufacturer Code","description":"Furuno","unit_of_measurement":"","value":"Furuno","raw_value":1855},{"id":"reserved_11","name":"Reserved","description":"","unit_of_measurement":"","value":3,"raw_value":3},{"id":"industry_code","name":"Industry Code","description":"Marine Industry","unit_of_measurement":"","value":"Marine","raw_value":4},{"id":"heave","name":"Heave","description":"","unit_of_measurement":"m","value":-0.036000000000000004,"raw_value":-36},{"id":"reserved_48","name":"Reserved","description":"","unit_of_measurement":"","value":65535,"raw_value":65535}],"source":9,"destination":255,"priority":7}'
Encoding frame: {"PGN":65280,"id":"furunoHeave","description":"Furuno: Heave","fields":[{"id":"manufacturer_code","name":"Manufacturer Code","description":"Furuno","unit_of_measurement":"","value":"Furuno","raw_value":1855},{"id":"reserved_11","name":"Reserved","description":"","unit_of_measurement":"","value":3,"raw_value":3},{"id":"industry_code","name":"Industry Code","description":"Marine Industry","unit_of_measurement":"","value":"Marine","raw_value":4},{"id":"heave","name":"Heave","description":"","unit_of_measurement":"m","value":-0.036000000000000004,"raw_value":-36},{"id":"reserved_48","name":"Reserved","description":"","unit_of_measurement":"","value":65535,"raw_value":65535}],"source":9,"destination":255,"priority":7}'

output:
09FF7 0FF00 3F9FDCFFFFFFFFFF
``` 



### Example Code
TBD
```python
from nmea2000.encoder import NMEA2000Encoder

# Initialize encoder
encoder = NMEA2000Encoder()

# Data to encode: vessel heading message (PGN 127250)
   message = NMEA2000Message(
        PGN=127250,
        priority=2,
        source=1,
        destination=255,
        fields=[
            NMEA2000Field(
                id="sid",
                raw_value=0,
            ),
            NMEA2000Field(
                id="heading",
                value=1, # 1 radian is 57 degrees
            ),
            NMEA2000Field(
                id="deviation",
                raw_value=0,
            ),
            NMEA2000Field(
                id="variation",
                raw_value=0,
            ),
            NMEA2000Field(
                id="reference",
                raw_value=0,
            ),
            NMEA2000Field(
                id="reserved_58",
                raw_value=0,
            )
        ]
    )

msg_bytes = encoder.encode_ebyte(_generate_test_message())
print(msg_bytes)
```
